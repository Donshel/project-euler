# Highly divisible triangular number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

**1**: 1  
**3**: 1,3  
**6**: 1,2,3,6  
**10**: 1,2,5,10  
**15**: 1,3,5,15  
**21**: 1,3,7,21  
**28**: 1,2,4,7,14,28  

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Mathematics

Any natural <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n"> greater than 1 can be written as the product of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?k"> powers of prime numbers.

    <!-- n=\prod_i^k{f_i}^{e_i} -->
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n%3D%5Cprod_i%5Ek%7Bf_i%7D%5E%7Be_i%7D">
</p>

With <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f_i"> the prime factors and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?e_i"> their non-zero power.

Therefore, the number of divisors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g"> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n"> is determined by

## Python implemention

Define

```python
d = 500
```

Initialize

```python
n = 2
```

Until stop

```python
while True:
```

Compute the prime factor decomposition of the `n`<sup>th</sup> triangle number

```python
    triangle = decomp(n * (n + 1) / 2)[1:]
```

If the number of divisors of `triangle` is superior to `d`, stop

```python
    e = [f[1] + 1 for f in triangle]
    g = reduce(mul, e)
    if g > d:
        break
```

Increment `n`

```python
    n += 1
```

Compose the triangle number from its prime factor decomposition

```python
triangle = comp(triangle)
```

### Answer

```python
triangle = 76576500
```
