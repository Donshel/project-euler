# Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<!-- 1,\,2,\,3,\,5,\,8,\,13,\,21,\,34,\,55,\,89,\,\dots -->

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Mathematics

The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n^\text{th}}"> term of the Fibonacci sequence is defined by

<!-- f_0=0,\,f_1=1\;\text{and}\;f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}\quad\forall\,n\,\geq\,2 -->

Therefore, each term has to be computed iteratively up to 4000000 with the two previous and is added to the sum only if it is even.

## Python implementation

Define

```python
f0 = 0
f1 = 1
fmax = 4000000
```

Iterate up to `fmax`

```python
while f1 <= fmax:
```

If even, add to the sum

```python
    if f1 % 2 == 0:
        sum += f1
```

Determine the next term

```python
    f0, f1 = f0, f0 + f1
```
