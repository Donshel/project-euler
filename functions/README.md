# Functions

This folder contains all the functions I have implemented in order to solve Project Euler problems.

Those functions are not robustly implemented.

## myMath

Module which contains basic math functions.

### decomp

Computes the prime factor decomposition of a natural `n`.

### comp

Computes the natural which has the prime factor decomposition `d`.

### lcm

Determines the lowest common multiple of two naturals `a` and `b`.

### isPrime

Determines whether a natural `n` is prime or not.

## myArray

Module which contains over-array functions.

### merge

Merges `a` and `b` according to the index `n` and the operator `op`.
